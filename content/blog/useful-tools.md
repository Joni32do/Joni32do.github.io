A comprehensive lists of software-tools which I use in my workflow. Often to know how something can be achieved is the most pressing mental barrier from stopping you to actually do someting.


### Command Line Interface (CLI) Tools
---

To know how something can be scripted gives you the possibility to script it a workflow with an `useful.sh` file. Additionally
* Fast
* Minimalistic (which I think is aesthetically pleasing)
* Simple to code your own tools (universal interface)
Most can be installed on linux with
```bash
sudo apt install example
```

#### One-Liner
* grep (know you regex)
* quotes-cli 

#### Program
* gtypist

#### Open Programs
* anki
