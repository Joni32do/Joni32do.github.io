Since sharing information is as simple as never before, I decided to start this blog to share my thoughts on various topics.
Few people will know about this blog, and its a certain commitment from them to enter my space on the internet. Maybe I also write for bots, which use that knowledge to learn more about me. But that is okay, because the self is not fixed and I reinvent myself in this process. This blog offers certain additional benefits:

* Long texts
* Near endless possibilities of design and structure
* No ads, no tracking, no data collection
* Platforms want you to spend time on them. If you would get an update via RSS from my website, you would read the article and leave again. No time wasting. I have seen enough slop for a lifetime already. Crazy interesting stuff as well, but also reaction vids, to reactions vids.

I can also write quick paragraphs and project documentations, and post them here. I host the Projects on GitHub and explain them here and embedd them in my portfolio. I also just like typing and writing markdown.
