My major in Simulation Technology (SimTech) at the University of Stuttgart is an interdisciplinary program that combines elements of
* computer science
* mathematics
* engineering 
* natural sciences 
  
to equip students with the skills needed to model, simulate, and analyze complex systems.



## A deep dive

For the curious readers I dedicate more blog posts to dive deeper into specific topics. It will summarize core concepts and link to further resources.


## Projects
With SimTech being theory heavy it is refreshing to apply concepts in practical projects. Here are some of them:

* **Uncertainty Quantification in Fluid Dynamics**: In my Bachelor Thesis I developed simulations to analyze how uncertainties in input parameters affect fluid flow predictions.
