## Spectrum Surrogates for Electromagnetic Compatibility

* Frequency response via high-dimensional embedding via principal component analysis (PCA)
* Alignment of specific special frequencies, refered to as warping 
* Surrogates with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) 
* sensitivity analysis with Sobol indices
* Application to electromagnetic compatibility simulations.
