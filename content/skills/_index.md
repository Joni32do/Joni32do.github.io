This skills showcase highlights my technical capabilities, from programming languages to architectural patterns and methodologies. The level have to be understood as a heuristic providing relative information. As I'm still a junior engineer, my practical experience is limited. This modesty shall not be confused for lack of experience, therefore I want to refer to my projects instead.
